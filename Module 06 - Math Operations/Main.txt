In math, PEMDAS is an acronym that helps students remember the order of operations. The order is:

    Parentheses (whatever is inside the parenthesis is performed first)
    Exponents
    Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
    Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

C# follows the same order as PEMDAS except for exponents.
