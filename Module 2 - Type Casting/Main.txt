Two types of castings

	Implicit
		Implicit casting occurs when you convert a smaller data type to a larger data type, and it happens automatically without the need for explicit type casting.
		The compiler knows that no data loss will occur during this conversion because the target type can accommodate all possible values of the source type.
	
	Explicit
		Explicit casting is required when you want to convert a larger data type to a smaller data type, and there is a potential for data loss or a change in representation.
		You need to use explicit casting operators to perform this conversion, and you should be cautious as it may result in loss of information.
