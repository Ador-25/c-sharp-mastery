# The Main method is the entry point of a C# application.

# There can only be one entry point in a C# program. If you have more than one class that has a Main method, you must compile your program with the StartupObject compiler option to specify which Main method to use as the entry point.

# Starting in C# 9, you can omit the Main method, and write C# statements as if they were in the Main method

# Main is default private

# Valid mains:
	public static void Main() { }
	public static int Main() { }
	public static void Main(string[] args) { }
	public static int Main(string[] args) { }
	public static async Task Main() { }
	public static async Task<int> Main() { }
	public static async Task Main(string[] args) { }
	public static async Task<int> Main(string[] args) { }


	class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Display the number of command line arguments.
            Console.WriteLine("HELLO");
        }
    }

    public struct MyStruct
    {
        public int Value;

        // Main method inside a struct (not a common practice)
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            MyStruct myStruct = new MyStruct();
            myStruct.Value = 42;

            Console.WriteLine("Value inside the struct: " + myStruct.Value);
        }
